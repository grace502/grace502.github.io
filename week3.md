Dear Readers, 
 The first thing we did immediately was refine our hypothesis, research question, and predictions for our research project. We spent the day doing that and finalized our hypothesis, 
 research question, and predictions. For the rest of the week, we read literature reviews, summarized the reviews, and analyzed them as quickly as we could. I read some literature reviews
 that relate to our project and my mentor said I should read and analyze it and see how we can implement what they did into our project. The last thing I did was practice my Pandas skills
 and use some datasets I found to practice with it. I found it difficult at first but I am getting used to it and will continue to practice it as we go on.
