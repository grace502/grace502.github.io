Dear Readers,
This week we started preparing for our Mid Summer Presentation and making finalizations on the slides. Making our scripts for the presentation. We practiced multiple times to make sure we
got it. During the presentation, I was super nervous but I and my teammates made jokes while we were having technical difficulties to ease my anxiety. We were able to present well
and that sets the tone for the other presentations. During the rest of the week, we look at journal articles and summarize them. On Friday we started on our outline and abstract and making plans for the last two weeks and a half.
