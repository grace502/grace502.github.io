Dear Readers, 
As we round up to the final week of this program, I finished doing the Lasso Regression and the data cleanup and preprocessing. This week was one of the toughest because we had to finish
the lasso regression and the statistical analysis. Even though it was a stressful week, I learned a lot from my mentor and she helped me learn about lasso regression and finishing up the
EDA.
