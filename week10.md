Dear Readers,
This was the last week for the program and I had lots of fun for the last few days. On Monday we praticed for our final presentation and with us practicing for the mid symposium it helped with
this. On Tuesday we did our final presentation and it was good. We went first so that help me knowing I don't have to stress later on. The last day was Wednesday and we wrapped up with the
final paper and we had to make sure it was good to send. We sent it to our mentor to revise it and after that we made some corrections to the paper.
