Dear Readers,
This week we started preparing for the mid-summer presentation and ensuring the slides were good. We had to ensure we kept the words on the slide simple and short. On Wednesday we did
not have our mid-summer presentation so we had a town hall and it was interesting, to say the least. We were able to give our feedback on what we liked and what could be improved on. 
Thursday was the fourth of July and on Friday we discussed our next step for next week.
