Dear Readers,
  On Monday we planned to start our exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and we discussed what columns need to be removed. It took us that day to watch some videos on EDA so we could start doing
that for our data the next day. On Tuesday we started practicing EDA on our data set and did some data cleaning. That same day we planned to start creating a slideshow for the high school
students visiting us on Thursday. On Wednesday we did the EDA and finished the slides for our presentation. On Thursday we practiced our presentation for the high schoolers. We finished our
EDA and looked into what machine-learning techniques we were using. On Friday Dr.Pandy came and we discussed next week's summer presentation and what we need to improve. We did our weekly
video and our weekly blog.
