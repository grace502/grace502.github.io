Dear Readers,
  On Monday I looked at the Morgan Database to look for articles to review. I asked my mentor Dr.Meeker for his approval to move forward and he approved of it so with that I did a literature
  review. I looked over important information and analysis I could add to our research. On Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday I also watched YouTube videos for the data analysis to implement into our test data. I looked at 
  different websites on different types of data analysis to implement.
