In the Intro to Machine Learning, I learned how to create my model step by step using Google Colab. We used Scikit Learn and Pandas for the data manipulation and analysis. We achieved that Logistic Regression gave better feedback than the Multinomial Logistic Regression. We had a Data Analysis session and I ran into issues with the code and learning Pandas. I used Colab and did not run the previous codes, so the code I wrote gave me an error. It was very informational and I learned a lot of things during the Machine Learning and Data Analysis sessions. In Python 102 I learned how to use a CSV and a JSON file.
