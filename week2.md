We brainstormed ideas for our research papers. We created two research questions and from there we were able to proceed to our hypothesis. We found patterns from our data set when we all 
came together on Monday to look at it. We didn't use any algorithms this week for our project. I encountered some challenges We initially struggled to properly translate one of our 
brainstormed ideas into a scientific research question. We ensured we had enough variables for our research and connected our project aim to the machine learning analysis aspect. We had 
challenges differentiating a hypothesis from a prediction. The different levels of science made it difficult because in the field of psychology, we can not prove a hypothesis. Still, we can 
test a prediction to provide evidence to support our hypothesis. Today we ran into challenges refining our hypothesis and prediction for our research question. An insight I gained this week 
was able to practice how to write a hypothesis in the field of psychology.
